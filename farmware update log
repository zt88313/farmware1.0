v0.1.9 – 2025-06-19

New features and improvements:
PrefsManager: added setNetworkState() and getNetworkState() to track online/offline mode
Utils.kt: added navigateToLoginActivity() and navigateToFeedbackForm()
Utils.kt: moved all existing navigation helpers (jumpToHomePage, jumpToDatabaseBrowsing, jumpToDataForm, navigateToAddDataForm) into one place
Utils.kt: consolidated the FeedbackMessage enum alongside PrefsManager methods
Added support for a new farming_field table (entity, DAO, UI)
Bug fixes:
In AdddataFormFragment, table names are now lowercased and spaces→underscores so multi-word tables (e.g. Farming Field) load correctly
In DatabaseBrowsingActivity, restoreSpinnerSelection() now normalizes both saved key and options so your selected table stays selected after add/edit
